## Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile :>

People sometimes ask me, who is Erick? Thatâ€™s a hard question, but letâ€™s try answering itâ€¦  Since I was little, Iâ€™ve been involved with technology, which made me hungry for knowledge and gave me the will to learn everything about this world. I was raised in Presidente GetÃºlio, Santa Catarina. Since itâ€™s a small town, there werenâ€™t many possibilities within the field of work Iâ€™ve always dreamed of, IT. Even then, I continued to pursue what it had to offer. As time went by, I got to know people that had the same dream as me, and those people opened the doors to the future I was always looking for. Thatâ€™s where my trajectory towards excitement in working with technology began, and since then, Iâ€™ve been going after the huge dream that is living off of what we love, always striving for new challenges to test my abilities and improve my work.

I'm a brazilian software analyst/developer, utilizing GeneXus, Java, SQL and occasionally Python, JavaScript and React.
